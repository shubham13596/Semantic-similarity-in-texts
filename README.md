# Semantic similarity in texts
Upload a excel file with multiple text points in separate rows. The code will give a semantic similarity score between each pieces of text.
Useful for cases wherein there is a large amount of similar data and needs to be sieved out.
Think multiple minutes of meeting gathered separately by people in a large meeting, multiple bugs being captured by separate people in a team.
